### **Business Problem**

One of the most important problems in **e-commerce** is the correct calculation of the points given to the products after sales. The solution to this problem means providing greater customer satisfaction for the e-commerce site, prominence of the product for the sellers and a seamless shopping experience for the buyers.

On the other hand, another problem is the correct ordering of the comments given to the products. Since misleading comments will directly affect the sale of the product, it will cause both financial loss and loss of customers.

*For example:*

When one user gives 5 points and the other user 5 points, are their contributions to **The Wisdom of Crowds** actually equal?
